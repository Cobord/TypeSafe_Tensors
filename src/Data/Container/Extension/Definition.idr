||| Extension of a container
||| This allows us to talk about the content, or payload of a container
public export

||| Container c can be said to be "full off" a type x
||| `fullOf` is sometimes used as infix operator to aid readability

||| Every extension is a functor : Type -> Type
public export

public export

||| Notably, Eq instance is not possible to write for a general Ext c a
||| This is because Eq needs to be total, and some containers have an infinite number of positions, meaning they cannot be checked for equality in finite time.
||| Meaning, the decidability works when the user provides a function to perform that check (perhaps by higher-order symbolic manipulation, as opposed to brute-force)
||| The trick of using DecEq to create an Eq instance is used in DPair?
||| TODO do we need this?

    ||| For each position in that shape, the values must be equal
    ||| Relying on rewrite to get the correct type for the position
    valuesEqual : (p : c.pos (e1.shapeExt)) ->
      e1.index p =
      e2.index (rewrite__impl (c.pos) (sym shapesEqual) p)
    {-
    Another alternative is to use DecEq, and a different explicit rewrite
     -}
