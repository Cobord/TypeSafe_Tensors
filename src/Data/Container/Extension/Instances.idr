  {-
  Technically it is possible to a) use the alias that is below, and b) define Tensor' here, but a decision was made not to do any of these.
  Rather, Tensor' was defined as a record, and this was done in Data.Tensor as
  in most linear algebra operations explicit and cumbersome shape annotations 
  would have been otherwise necessary. Likewise, the definition of usual 
  interfaces the datatype Tensor' are often involved, making it much simpler
  to create a separate file for it.
