# Type safe neural network architectures

This is an Idris 2 tensor framework which:
* Is type-safe (meaning indexing and contractions fail at compile time unless types match)
* Works for non-cubical tensors (including trees, and streams)
* Is made to be ergonomically usable (see the examples)




Planned:
* Type-safe einsum
